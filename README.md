🏠 House Rent Prediction – India 🇮🇳
An ML-powered app to predict house rent based on user input features using Python, Streamlit, and Scikit-learn.

🚀 Project Overview

✅ Number of Bedrooms (BHK)

✅ Size (in sqft)

✅ Number of Bathrooms

✅ City

✅ Furnishing Status

It also includes a fun and engaging UI with:

🎉 A “Surprise Me” button to display rental-related trivia and funny facts

🎯 An easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit

🛠️ Tech Stack
